# Session handoff

> Last updated: 2026-05-21 | Branch: main

Per-author scratchpad for picking up where the previous working
session left off. Expected to churn between sessions. Durable
documentation lives elsewhere; this file records only what is true
*now* and what is the next concrete step.

- Headline performance and per-kernel measurements:
  [`inventory.md`](inventory.md), [`comparison_to_sota.md`](comparison_to_sota.md),
  [`../README.md`](../README.md).
- Optimization postmortems: [`gpu_reflections.md`](gpu_reflections.md)
  (observation catalogue, lettered A–LL plus numbered Insights).
- Structural changes and audit history: [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).
- Documentation map: [`index.md`](index.md).
- Open issues: [GitHub](https://github.com/pjt222/bare-metal/issues).
- Published kernel corpus: [HF dataset `pjt222/ga104-cuda-kernels`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pjt222/ga104-cuda-kernels)
  — re-sync with `make publish-hf` (needs `HF_TOKEN` in `.env`).

## Current state

All five development phases are complete. The active optimization
queue is near-empty; the remaining items are research-grade scope.

### Pinned headline numbers (RTX 3070 Ti Laptop, sm_86)

Post-warmup, 3-run mean unless noted. Sources in

Flash Attention plateau: ~11.5 TFLOPS = 6.6 % of FP16 Tensor Core
peak (174 TFLOPS). Path:
`regpv → lean state → Q reg cache → smem_work elimination (1.40×)
→ cp.async at 8 warps (additional +0.20×)`.

### Open GitHub issues

All optimization and build-correctness work is shipped. The only open
issues are the **benchmark-pipeline hardening roadmap** filed at the
end of the 2026-05-21 session — no queued kernel work.

| #   | Title                                                          |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 124 | `bench-all` one-click full-corpus benchmark runner (epic)      |
| 125 | Clock-lock support for the benchmark pipeline (WSL probe gate) |
| 126 | Record GPU mode (hybrid/dGPU) in benchmark metadata            |
| 127 | Smoke-test coverage gap: flash_attn / conv2d not built by `make test` |
| 128 | Overclocked single-kernel showcase mode (deferred)             |

Design basis for all five: [`benchmark_methodology.md`](benchmark_methodology.md).

## Latest session — issue-queue drain + benchmark planning (2026-05-21)

Goal: resolve every open GitHub issue. All four closed. A follow-up
planning pass on benchmark-pipeline reproducibility then filed five
roadmap issues (#124-128, see "Open GitHub issues" above) and shipped
their design basis — `docs/benchmark_methodology.md` and
`scripts/probe/probe_gpu_power.R` + `probe_clock_lock.R` (commit
`a149859`). Key finding: the GPU is pinned at its 150 W VBIOS power
ceiling — no headroom; reproducible numbers need clock-locking or
cooldown, not more power.

| #   | Commit  | Resolution                                                       |
|-----|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 122 | df1b4a1 | `make clean` scoped to untracked artifacts — every deletion candidate filtered through `git ls-files --error-unmatch`, so tracked handtuned `.cuasm` / experiment cubins/sass survive. |
| 103 | cd4f34a | Cross-attention regime dispatch: `dispatch.h` (`cross_attn_pick` returns a `{cubin, symbol, smem}` descriptor — the variants are driver-API cubin kernels, not host wrappers), `bench_dispatch.cu` (9 checks pass), README section. |
| 104 | —       | Closed not-planned: fragment-shfl tracking issue, no target kernel — every TC kernel with a per-row reduction already applies the pattern. |
| 105 | —       | Closed not-planned: #96 sub-task C, speculative non-TC SASS hand-tunes, no measurement-backed target. |

Build-graph gap found and fixed while pushing the above:

| Commit  | Fix                                                              |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 82e726b | `.gitignore` pruned (stale `phase*/`, dead `tools/CuAssembler/`); deleted spent `scripts/fix_cuda_context.R` codemod. |
| 8d94d5a | `make test` now depends on `cubins`. The `test` target built only bench executables; benches load cubins at runtime via `cuModuleLoad`, so post-`make clean` the smoke tests ran hollow ("No kernels found", swallowed by `|| true`) and the pre-push `bench_regress.R` reported every kernel as CRASH. Full `bench_regress.R` passes with 0 regressions once cubins are present. |

## Next steps

The kernel optimization queue is empty. Open work is the
benchmark-pipeline hardening roadmap (#124-128):

1. **#127 — smoke coverage gap** (`good first issue`): wire the
   `flash_attn` / `conv2d` bench exes into a smoke group so
   `bench_regress.R` covers them instead of SKIPping. Small.
2. **#125 — clock-lock probe**: run
   `sudo Rscript scripts/probe/probe_clock_lock.R`; the verdict
   decides whether clock-locking is a usable lever.
3. **#126 — GPU-mode metadata**: decide the source of truth
   (env var vs Windows-host query) and add the `gpu_mode` field.
4. **#124 — `bench-all` runner** (epic): the big one — build it on
   the architecture in `benchmark_methodology.md` once #125/#126
   land.
5. **#128 — OC showcase**: deferred.

Pending hardware change: user switched hybrid → dGPU mode (needs a
restart). After reboot, re-run `Rscript scripts/probe/probe_gpu_power.R`
— if `Max Power Limit` rose above 150 W, the clock-lock plan shifts.

Closed earlier, not in scope unless reopened:

- **#32 polyhedral spring networks** — literature scoping lives in
  `docs/polyhedral_spring_networks.md`. Re-open only if a kernel
  implementation is wanted.

## Hardware constraint (recap)

GA104 sm_86, RTX 3070 Ti Laptop. 48 SMs (desktop bin) or 46 SMs
(laptop bin). 100 KB max shared memory per SM. FP32 21.7 TFLOPS,
FP16 Tensor Core 174 TFLOPS, INT8 Tensor Core 348 TOPS, DRAM
608 GB/s, L2 4 MB.

The 50 KB shared-memory cliff is the dominant tile-size constraint:
blocks at ≤50 KB run at 2 blocks/SM (8 warps, latency hidden); blocks
at >50 KB drop to 1 block/SM (4 warps, exposed DRAM stalls,
measured 2× regression).

The four laws of GA104 (full statement in `../AGENTS.md` and
`docs/tutorial/06-the-four-laws.md`):

1. Feed Tensor Cores continuously.
2. Read each byte of DRAM at most once per kernel.
3. Fill the warp schedulers — 8 warps/SM is the floor.
4. Never cross the 50 KB shared-memory cliff.

## Prior session log

Removed from this file. The 677-line per-session walls that
previously lived here are preserved in git history; relevant
durable findings have been integrated into `gpu_reflections.md`
(observations) and `CHANGELOG.md` (structural changes). To recover
a specific prior session, browse:
